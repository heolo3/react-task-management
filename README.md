This is one of the practice projects from Max Schwarzmueller's Udemy course on Learning React from scratch. 

In this project, we are designing a project management page utilizing React and TailwindCSS. The page features a sidebar for creating/storing/recalling projects, a page for creating projects, a recallable project page for also adding sub-tasks to a given project, and a general landing page for display when first arriving on the page.

In this project, we focused on employing important concepts of React, including using State/Hooks/Refs, styling with TailwindCSS, passing props and functions down through various components (drilling), and other more basic fundamentals.
